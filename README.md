# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's services, is a critical issue for businesses as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we build and train an ANN model to analyze patterns in customer behavior and predict the likelihood of churn. The dataset includes various customer-related features such as demographics, account information, and service usage metrics. By applying feature engineering and tuning the model's hyperparameters, we aim to achieve high accuracy in predicting churn, enabling businesses to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to improve retention. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, with a focus on optimizing performance through the selection of relevant features, network architecture, and evaluation metrics.
